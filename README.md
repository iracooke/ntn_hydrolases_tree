# NtN Hydrolases in Cnidarians

Scripts and code to examine evolutionary history of NtN hydrolases in corals

There are two main RMarkdown files. 

1. [Large Tree](01_large_tree.md) which describes how we built the tree of NtN Hydrolases across a broad range of taxa
2. [Coral Tree](02.coral_tree.md) which describes how we build the smaller tree focussed on Cnidaria
